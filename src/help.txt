**Commands:**
**!add (subreddit) (keywords)**: add a keyword that you want to be notified about.
**!delete (subreddit) (keywords)**: delete a keyword that you have set.
**!list**: displays a list of all currently added keywords

**A note on keywords:**
Keywords can be chained together or treated as individual search terms. To search for an exact phrase, use quotation marks.
For example, if I were to search for the keywords **quick fox** and a post had the phrase: 
"The **quick** brown **fox** jumps over the lazy dog" you would get a notification as it matches the bolded text.
However if you typed in **"quick fox"** as an exact search, with the quotation marks, then you would NOT get a notification for that phrase.

Same thing applies for deleting a keyword, if the keyword was an exact search, then use quotations around the search term when deleting it, otherwise just type the word normally.
If you are unsure about what to type to delete a listing, type !list and type the keyword how you see it there.
